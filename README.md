Forward and inverse Constant-Q Sliding DFT according to [[1]](#1) with following features:

- Arbitrary octave resolution ([quarter tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone) by default)
- Built-in parameterizable cosine family window (Hann by default)
- Customizable time and frequency domain data type in C++
- Endless single or multiple sample processing at once
- Optional analysis latency control parameter
- Real-time analysis and synthesis capability

## WIP

- [ ] Readme
- [ ] Docstrings
- [x] PyPI package [qdft](https://pypi.org/project/qdft)
- [ ] Sliding [chromagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_feature) as a bonus
